This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2.


I (Malihe Sheidaiefar) built an API for a movie collection.

A fake-backend service at this project which can handel API's.

When user authenticates, JWT token is returned.

Every user (based on role based access) is able to see collections of other people, but to be able to change only their own collection.

API endpoints have unit tests.

====================================

After getting the project and installing libraries ( npm i) and running it `ng serve` , 
you will see a Home page on (localhost address):

At the (right of header) you see an icon to login page (localhost/account) ;


If you want to have the role of Admin  => please use of these login information : { user: sheyda888 , password: 123 }

If you want to have the role of Viewer => please use of these login information : { user: tina , password: 123 }

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
